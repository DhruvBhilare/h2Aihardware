The bracelet needs to connect to the internet and our web server. It has a 3-second initialization phase, after which tremor detection is activated. The temperature and humidity sensors also record environmental data.

For motor testing, due to onboard limitations, we need to upload the tracking code separately before launching the web app to conduct motor testing via Bluetooth.

The camera accessory has a similar initialization phase, after which you can perform any two of our onboard tests: the Clock Drawing Test and the Serial 7 Subtraction Test.

All recorded data points update in real-time between the hardware and the web app.
